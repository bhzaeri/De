\begin{frame}{Social Fabric}
	\begin{block}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\justifying
			\item Social Fabric was proposed by \cite{R:1}
			\newline \item The Social Fabric is a dynamic information skin created by the agents interactions in a social context.
			%\item The informational skins are formed by the connectivity of each agent with other agents.
			%\item These dynamic formations control the topology and type of interactions in the dynamic social sculpture. \cite{reynolds2008computing}
			%\item The purpose of the Social Fabric metaphor is to describe group behaviors and engineered emergent phenomena.
			\newline \item Social interactions between individuals are modeled using an undirected graph $G(V;E)$ \cite{sterling2004aggregation}.

	\begin{frame}{Research Motivation}
		\begin{block}{Optimization Problems}
			\begin{itemize}

				%\item It is a set of 15 real-world numerical optimization problems that was used in IEEE-CEC2015 and 2016 competitions on testing evolutionary algorithms.
				%\item Because of their high dimensionality, multimodality, and copious local optima, they are suitable to inspect and compare the capabilities of evolutionary algorithms regarding robustness, scalability, adaptability, etc.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{block}
		\begin{equation}
		Y=f(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \cdots, x_{D})
		\end{equation}
		For example: 
		\begin{equation}
		f_{1}(x)=x_{1}^{2}+10^{6}\sum_{i=2}^{D}x_{i}^2
		\end{equation}
		
%		\begin{block}{}
%			$y=f(x\textsubscript{1}, x\textsubscript{2}, \cdots, x\textsubscript{n})$\newline
%			It aims at finding a vector $x\textup{*}$ which holds:
%			\begin{center}
%				123%$f(x\textup{*})<f(x)$ for all $x$ vectors.
%			\end{center}

	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Reaserch Goals}
		\begin{block}{}
			\begin{itemize}

				\item In this research work, I am going to improve Cultural Algorithms from three aspects:
				\item Applying PSO algorithm to current Social Fabric based CAs.
				\item Introducing a Irregular Neighborhood Restructuring operator to increase the level of diversity.
				\item Improving the robustness of the Belief Space by introducing a Confidence-based knowledge source inspired from Statistics.
				\item For the comparison purpose, I am going to use CEC2015 benchmark optimization functions to compare my proposed approaches against already proposed algorithms.

	\section{Related Works}
	
	\begin{frame}{Related Works I}
			\begin{itemize}
				\justifying
				\item \cite{R:1} introduced the idea of Social Fabric as a new influence function in CA by deploying a social network between individuals.
				\item \cite{che2010robust} replaced the traditional idea of roulette wheel with the vector voting model to determine the controller KS in each iteration.
				\item \cite{ali2012socio} introduced the neighborhood restructuring in Social Fabric with a two-layered multi-population CA model.
				\item \cite{chen2006tribe} introduced Tribe-PSO algorithm as a multi-tribe population-based algorithm to utilize the parallel nature of evolutionary algorithms.

	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Related Works II}
		\begin{itemize}

	\begin{frame}{Socially inspired algorithms}
		\begin{block}{Swarm Intelligence}
			\justifying
			\cite{kennedy2001swarm} Socially inspired algorithms(Swarm Intelligence) utilize a population of semi-rational agents(rather than dumb individuals) that have the ability to perceive their surrounding environment and cooperate with other agents in a \alert{self-organized} manner. \newline Cooperation happens through communication. The agents communicate in two general ways: Direct and Indirect.

		\justifying
		\begin{block}{Belief Space}
			There are five types of \alert{knowledge sources} in the Belief Space. 
			%The elite members of Population space are selected and sent to the Belief space to extract and utilize their knowledge through the search process.

%			\begin{itemize}
%				\item Topographic: It divides the whole landscape into cells and keeps track of the best individual in each cell. This KS is used to split the current search regions into subregions along each dimension of the problem. Each area will be divided into two new subregions in each generation of the optimization process.

			\begin{itemize}
				\item In this model of CA, knowledge sources are allowed to influence the population through layers of networks. \newline
%				\item Individuals might be participating in different networks which might support several layers of such networks in a hierarchical manner.
				\item The interplay of these layers and networks leads us to the concept of "\alert{Social Fabric}". \cite{reynolds2008computing} \newline
				%\item Social fabrics are formed by the connectivity of individuals together which control the topology and type of interactions in the dynamic social sculpture. 
				\item The population is divided into multiple subgroups or \alert{tribes}. \cite{ali2016leveraged}
%				\item In this way, the simple interactions of individuals leads to complex community-oriented behaviours which could be expressed as an emergent phenomenon.

	\begin{frame}{Thesis Statement}
		\begin{block}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\justifying			
				\item In this research work, I am going to improve Cultural Algorithms from three aspects:
				\item Applying PSO algorithm to current Social Fabric based CAs.
				\item Introducing a Irregular Neighbourhood Restructuring operator to increase the level of diversity.
				\item Improving the robustness of the Belief Space by introducing a Confidence-based knowledge source inspired from Statistics.
				\item For the comparison purpose, I am going to use CEC2015 benchmark optimization functions to compare my proposed approaches against already proposed algorithms.

%		\begin{block}{Heterogenous Neighborhood Restructuring}
%			\begin{itemize}
%				\item In this type of restructuring, the topology of social fabric is not considered regular.
%				\item It is a directed graph which means relationships between individuals are not reciprocal.
%				\item Neighbourhoods are \alert{heterogenous}. Each individual has a different neighbourhood size.
%				\item In the standard Social Fabric, tribes' topologies change from a regular form into another in a macroscopic way in the presence of stagnation.
%				\item In my proposed idea, each individual decides to increase/decrease its own neighbourhood size based on its experience.

%				\item Sudden changes in the values of individuals might get the normative ranges fluctuated.
%				\item To avoid fluctuations, it needs to be improved regarding robustness.

%				\item There is some level of arbitrariness in choosing the range size to estimate the mean.
%				\item Interval estimates are often desirable because the estimate of the mean varies from sample to sample.
